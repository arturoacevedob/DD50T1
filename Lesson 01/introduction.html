      >Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis The Wise? I thought not.
      It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend. Darth
      Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so pozerful and so wise he could use
      the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life… He had such a
      knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about
      from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some
      consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful… the only thing he was
      afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did.
      Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his
      apprentice killed him in his sleep. Ironic. He could save others from
      death, but not himself.</small
